To Do: 

-"Item Details" page

-View Updates
Plotting?
Ways to viszualize?

-Square Subtraction 
-item type table? - working
-Sort table by type

-Item-specific update ID for Class Update 'item_update.' Denotes the number of times a specific item has been updated. 
would help with problems like update_history 
(or add stock_change directly to each update...)

-Adding notes to updates? 

-"Sort By" feature on items page which allows to sort by item type, size, etc. 

-Add initial stock to "add item" page 

-Add validation on size: can't be nil because then I can't sort it. 

- Why does update stock only work if I reload the page FIRST. Doesn't submit if I navigate to /update_stock from /items 

- why does "edit item" only take the first word from the item name
